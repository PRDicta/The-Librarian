## How we recognize contributions

We believe every contribution matters, not just code. Here's how we say thanks:

- **CONTRIBUTORS.md** — Your name goes here, permanently. We credit the type
  of contribution (code, docs, testing, ideas, bug reports, design).
- **Release notes** — Significant contributions are called out by name in the
  release that includes them.
- **Commit credit** — Co-authored-by headers in commits that build on your
  work or ideas.

## Want to contribute?

See our [CLA](CLA.md) for the one-time contributor agreement, then open a PR.
We're glad you're here.
