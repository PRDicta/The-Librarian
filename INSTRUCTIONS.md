# STOP. BOOT THE LIBRARIAN BEFORE RESPONDING.

Before generating ANY reply — even to "Hi" — run this command:

```bash
librarian boot --compact
```

Then launch full context in the background:

```bash
librarian boot --full-context
```

Parse the boot JSON. Follow the `operations` field — it contains all session rules.
No exceptions. No "I'll do it next message." Boot first, then respond.
