# Commercial License — The Librarian

The Librarian is dual-licensed. The open-source edition is available under
the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE).
A commercial license is available for organizations that need to embed,
distribute, or deploy The Librarian without AGPL obligations.

## When you need a commercial license

The AGPL-3.0 requires that if you modify The Librarian and make it
available over a network (including as part of a SaaS product), you must
release your complete source code under the same license. A commercial
license removes this requirement.

You likely need a commercial license if you are:

- **An OEM or ISV** embedding The Librarian in a proprietary product
- **A SaaS provider** offering The Librarian's capabilities as part of a hosted service
- **An enterprise** that cannot comply with AGPL source-code disclosure requirements
- **A VAR** bundling The Librarian with other commercial software

## Pricing

All commercial licenses are **perpetual** — pay once, use forever on the
version you purchased.

## Personal and open-source use

If you are using The Librarian for personal projects, academic research,
or open-source work where you can comply with AGPL-3.0 terms, no
commercial license is needed. The open-source edition is fully functional.
