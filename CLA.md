# Contributor License Agreement — The Librarian

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Librarian, a project of
Dicta Technologies Inc. ("Dicta"). This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
clarifies the intellectual property rights granted with contributions from any
person or entity.

**You only need to sign this once.** It covers all current and future
contributions to The Librarian.

## What you're agreeing to

By submitting a contribution (pull request, patch, documentation, or any other
material) to The Librarian, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. You retain your copyright

You keep full ownership of your contribution. Nothing in this agreement
transfers your copyright to Dicta.

### 2. You grant Dicta a broad license

You grant Dicta Technologies Inc. a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free, irrevocable license to:

- Use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your contribution
- Sublicense your contribution under any license, including the AGPL-3.0
  and any commercial license Dicta offers for The Librarian
- Create derivative works from your contribution

This grant is necessary because The Librarian is dual-licensed. Without it,
your contribution could only be distributed under the AGPL-3.0, which would
prevent its inclusion in the commercial edition.

### 3. You confirm you have the right to contribute

You represent that:

- The contribution is your original work, or
- You have the necessary rights to submit it (e.g., your employer has
  authorized the contribution), and
- The contribution does not violate any third party's intellectual property
  rights

### 4. You understand there is no obligation

Dicta is not obligated to use, merge, or include your contribution. Submitting
a contribution does not create an employment or contractor relationship.

## How to sign

When you open your first pull request, the CLA assistant bot will ask you to
sign. You sign by adding your name and email to the comment. One signature
covers all future contributions.

If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, please have an authorized
representative sign the Entity CLA by contacting licensing@usedicta.com.

## Why this matters

The Librarian uses a dual-license model (AGPL-3.0 + Commercial). The CLA
ensures that every line of code in the project can be distributed under both
licenses. Without it, contributions would be locked to AGPL-only, fragmenting
the codebase and limiting what we can ship to commercial users.

We want contributors to feel good about this arrangement. Your work stays
yours, the open-source edition stays free, and the commercial edition funds
continued development of the project.
